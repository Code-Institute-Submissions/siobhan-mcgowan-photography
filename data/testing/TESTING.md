### Overall:

**Responsiveness-**

 - **Planning:**This project was required to be totally responsive, and mobile friendly as it would be intended to be used on the fly. hence the choice of the Foundry theme relying heavily on BootStrap as my main framework for it's cut down components that result in a clean, uncluttered view, with access to all features through hidden buttons and menus. Testing was done using dev-tools during the entire project, and also a final test of the entire site after completion.
 - **Testing:** Testing throughout the project was relatively simple using the Foundry/Bootstrap class modifiers.
 - **Result:** A clean, responsive site, that works as expected. With no stray elements, or unwanted spacings.
 - **Verdict:** Test passed as expected and the site is responsive.

**Design**
 - **Planning:** Overal design had to be contrasting, to make specific elements jump out at the user. A template called Foundry was used to achieve this.
 - **Testing:** A specific template from the pack was chosen. All version were shown to testers, and notes taken on favourites.
 - **Result:** The overall theme of the site worked, and all tester were happy with the layout and design.
 - **Verdict:** Test passed, and overall design of the site works well together.

**HTML Code**
 - **Planning:** HTML Code would need to be checked on a regular basis to ensure it is up to the standard for HTML code.
 - **Testing:** Code was regularly run through the HTML Validator application provided by W3.
 - **Result:** Code passed with no errors meaning it is up to standard.
 - **Verdict:** Test passed, and overall code of the site is up to standard.

### Features:

**Search**
 - **Planning:** A search feature would be needed for users to search for specific photos.
 - **Testing (Phase 1):** Search feature implimented and returns photos that contain the search query in the name, but would not search other aspects of the object.
 - **Testing (Phase 2):** Search function updated to check multiple fields. Search now checks category and tags.
 - **Results:** Search function works as expected, and returns every possible result based on search criteria.
 - **Verdict:** Search function works as expected.

**Banner**
 - **Planning:** A banner required for the landing page of the site.  
 - **Testing (Phase 1):** Banner displayed as expected, but was static. A new function was required for the site admin to have the ability to change to banner.
 - **Testing (Phase 2):** Function added to change banner. Banner did not load when multiple banners were selected.
 - **Testing (Phase 3):** For loop changed to only accept the final image in a loop.
 - **Results:** Banner now functions as expected even with multiple files selected, and admin can change as needed.
 - **Verdict:** Banner displays and works as expected.
